## :zap: Overview

- After an intense coding bootcamp, I decided to challenge myself onto another project. I wanted to create an **ecommerce site in TypeScript** as I have been wanting to learn the language. I also really wanted to **push myself with Material UI** and explore other features it has to offer.

- In this project I also wanted to **strictly use React Hooks** and **learn and implement** the `useContext()` functionality, something of which was completely new to me.

- This is the closest I will ever get to owning a plant shop so it's a really fun project to build! :nerd_face:

## :microscope: Planning

- I **got in contact with Matt Goodwill, a UX Designer** to help me create the foundations of styling the site. **My brief 'make it as minimalist and Danish as possible'.** Luckily, they go hand in hand. In return, Matt gave me templates of hex colours and fonts. I really enjoyed the process of working with a designer.
