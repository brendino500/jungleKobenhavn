## :zap: Overview

- View my projet [here](#)

- After an intense coding bootcamp, I decided to challenge myself onto another project. I wanted to create an **ecommerce site in TypeScript** as I have been wanting to learn the language. I also really wanted to **push myself with Material UI** and explore other features it has to offer.

- In this project I also wanted to **strictly use React Hooks** and **learn and implement** the `useContext()` functionality, something of which was completely new to me.

- This is the closest I will ever get to owning a plant shop so it's a really fun project to build! :nerd_face:

## :stopwatch: Timeframe

- I wanted to give myself a deadline of 7 days. However, since this was my **first project with TypeScript _and_ React hooks and the `useContext()` functionality**, the project took a week longer.
- Total time: 14 days

## :microscope: Planning

- I **got in contact with Matt Goodwill, a UX Designer** to help me create the foundations of styling the site. **My brief was 'make it as minimalist and Danish as possible'.** Luckily, they go hand in hand. In return, Matt gave me **templates of hex colours and fonts**. I really **enjoyed the process of working with a designer** as this **enabled me to focus on the code** rather than the design, which at times I can be very distracted by.

- As I really wanted to be **strict with how I planned this project, I made wireframes to the best of my UX knowledge** (not a lot). I knew this was going to change as the project progressed, but I thought it would be better to have a basic idea rather than make it up on the spot.

  I really like using Trello.

## :fire: Features

- As I wanted to push myself with Material, I tried to implement a lot of Material components I had not used before. One of the main components is the side drawer which also acts as the basket.
